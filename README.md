Task: Develop a Simple Product Review REST API Endpoint in PHP



Create a basic REST API endpoint using PHP, excluding any frameworks such as Laravel. The objective is to enable users to submit product reviews through POST requests containing JSON data, including a product ID, user ID, and review text. Ensure fundamental input validation and provide appropriate responses.



Requirements:

- Utilize Raw PHP to construct the API endpoint.

- Implement basic input validation, checking for non-empty fields and valid numerical IDs.

- The endpoint should respond with a success message for valid data or an error message for invalid data.



Optional:

- Connect to a MySQL database to store the product review, provided it can be accomplished within the specified time limit.



Deliverables:

Submit the PHP script(s) containing the developed API endpoint. You can provide a link to a GitHub repository for review.



Evaluation Criteria:

Candidates will be evaluated based on their proficiency in using raw PHP, handling JSON data, implementing input validations, and, if applicable, establishing communication with a database.

## How To Use:

- Run review_sql.sql
- In review.php update database credentials
- To test use index.html form
